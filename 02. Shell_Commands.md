# Bash Script
### Initial bash file
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
### Initial bash file for docker (docker won't work with /bash)
```bash
#!/bin/sh
```
### Variable & Print  -- Check all default variables below
```bash
## Define variable in bash script same like python but before call need to use $ sing
name = "name"
age = 10
Array=(egg burger milk)                      # array
for i in "${Array[@]}";do echo "$i";done     # itarate array
$name                                        # variable will call, if has any action it will happen or print
echo $name                                   # variable will print
. /another_script.sh                         # call another script
```
### Taking one argument if not found the Show error and exist
```bash
# argument from terminal pass as $1 $2 $3 like this way
# example : ./setup.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
if [ -z "$1" ]
  then
    echo -e "Usage: ./setup.sh <project_name>"
    exit 1
fi
PROJECT_NAME=$1  # argument as $1
```
### Taking argument two arguments if not found the Show error and exist
```bash
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./setup.sh <project_name> <environment_name>"
    exit 1
fi
PROJECT_NAME=$1  # First argument as $1
ENV_NAME=$2      # Second argument as $2
```
### Concat
```bash
PROJECT_NAME = "project-name"
ENV_NAME = "-venv"

ENV="$PROJECT_NAME$ENV_NAME"  # Or
ENV="${PROJECT_NAME}-venv"
```
### Creating File
```bash
mkdir nginx
cat <<EOF > nginx/nginx.conf
server {
    ....
}
EOF
``
## Special keywords
```bash
mv env.template .env            # Move file and remove
mv $PROJECT_NAME/* tmp_files    # move one folder to another

awk '$0 == "# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!" {i=1;next}; i && i++ < 2' ./$PROJECT_NAME/settings.py | tr -d '[:space:]' >> .env
sed -e "s/{PROJECT_NAME}/$PROJECT_NAME/g" settings.template > $PROJECT_NAME/settings.py
# First case, awk uses to find django secrect key with a special technique and placed in .env file
# Second case, sed replace project name variable with targeted PROJECT_NAME text, and move it in setting.py

sleep 10     # sleep 10s
set -e       # set exit if any error happen

# Find and Replace
first="I drive a BMW and Volvo"
second="Audi"
echo "${first/BMW/"$second"}"

```
## Conditional Statements - see below Expression of conditional statement
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands
elif [ another_condition ]; then
    # commands
else
    # commands
fi
```

### For Loop
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo $i
done
```
### While Loop
```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $counter"
    ((counter++))  # Increment the counter
done
```
### Function
```bash
function_name() {
    # commands
}
# Call the function
function_name
```
## All default variable of shell scripting
1. Positional Parameters:
```
$0 $1, $2, ... $n: The positional argument passed to the script.
Example: If you run a script called script.sh with ./script.sh arg1 arg2, then $0 would be script.sh, $1 would be arg1, and $2 would be arg2.
```
2. Array-related Variables:
```
$#: The number of positional parameters passed to a script or function.
$@: An array containing all positional parameters passed to a script or function.
$*: A single string containing all positional parameters, separated by the first character of the IFS variable.
Example: echo "Number of arguments: $#"
```
3. User Environment Variables:
```
$HOME: The path to the user's home directory.
$USER: The username of the current user.
$PATH: A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
$SHELL: The path to the user's default shell.
$PWD: The present working directory.
$UID: The user ID of the current user.
$EUID: The effective user ID of the current user.
Example: if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then  # 0 mean root
```
4. System Information:
```
$HOSTNAME: The hostname of the system.
$HOSTTYPE: A string representing the hardware type of the system.
$OSTYPE: The type of operating system (e.g., "linux-gnu").
$MACHTYPE: The machine type (e.g., "x86_64").
Example: If your system's hostname is mycomputer and it's running on Linux, then $HOSTNAME will be mycomputer and $OSTYPE will be linux-gnu.
```
5. Time and Date:
```
$DATE: The current date and time (using the date command).
$SECONDS: The number of seconds since the shell was started.
$RANDOM: A random integer between 0 and 32767.
```
6. Process-related Variables:
```
$LINENO: The current line number in the script.
$FUNCNAME: The name of the current function (if inside a function).
Example: echo "Current line number: $LINENO"
```

## Expression of conditional statement
1. File Test Operators:
```
-e file: Checks if the file exists.
-f file: Checks if the file exists and is a regular file.
-d directory: Checks if the directory exists.
-s file: Checks if the file exists and is not empty.
-r file: Checks if the file is readable.
-w file: Checks if the file is writable.
-x file: Checks if the file is executable.
-L file: Checks if the file is a symbolic link.
```
2. String Comparison Operators:
```
string1 = string2: Checks if string1 is equal to string2.
string1 != string2: Checks if string1 is not equal to string2.
-z string: Checks if string is empty (zero length).
-n string: Checks if string is not empty.
```
3. Numeric Comparison Operators:
```
integer1 -eq integer2: Checks if integer1 is equal to integer2.
integer1 -ne integer2: Checks if integer1 is not equal to integer2.
integer1 -lt integer2: Checks if integer1 is less than integer2.
integer1 -le integer2: Checks if integer1 is less than or equal to integer2.
integer1 -gt integer2: Checks if integer1 is greater than integer2.
integer1 -ge integer2: Checks if integer1 is greater than or equal to integer2.
```
4. Logical Operators:
```
! expression: Negates the result of the expression.
expression1 -a expression2: Logical AND (short-circuit evaluation).
expression1 -o expression2: Logical OR (short-circuit evaluation).
```
